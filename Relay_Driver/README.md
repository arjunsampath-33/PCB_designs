## Relay Driver PCB 

This project demonstrates the design of a transistor-based relay driver circuit, covering the complete PCB development workflow from schematic to fabrication-ready files.

### Description
The relay driver uses a BC547 NPN transistor to control a 5V SPDT relay using a low-voltage input signal. The design includes proper base biasing, flyback diode protection, and visual status indicators for power and relay activation.

### Features
- 5V SPDT relay (SRD-05VDC-SL-C)
- Transistor-based relay switching
- Flyback diode protection for relay coil
- Power ON indicator (Green LED)
- Relay status indicator (Blue LED)

### Components Used
- Relay: SRD-05VDC-SL-C
- Transistor: BC547
- Diode: 1N4007
- Resistors: 1kΩ, 10kΩ, 330Ω
- LEDs: 3mm Green & Blue

### Design Details
- Designed using EasyEDA
- Single-layer PCB with manual routing
- Wider traces used for relay contact paths
- Clear silkscreen labeling for easy wiring
- Fabrication-ready Gerber files generated

### Files Included
- Schematic (PDF)
- PCB Layout Image
