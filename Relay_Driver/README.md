### Description
The relay driver uses a BC547 NPN transistor to control a 5V SPDT relay using a low-voltage input signal. The design includes proper base biasing, flyback diode protection, and visual status indicators for power and relay activation.

### Features
- 5V SPDT relay (SRD-05VDC-SL-C)
- Transistor-based relay switching
- Flyback diode protection for relay coil
- Power ON indicator (Green LED)
- Relay status indicator (Blue LED)

### Components Used
- Relay: SRD-05VDC-SL-C
- Transistor: BC547
- Diode: 1N4007
- Resistors: 1kΩ, 10kΩ, 330Ω
- LEDs: 3mm Green & Blue
