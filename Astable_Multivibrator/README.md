### Contents
- PCB schematic and layout designed using EasyEDA
- Fully assembled PCB
- Working demonstration video

### Description
The astable multivibrator generates a continuous square wave without any stable state. The PCB was designed, fabricated, assembled, and tested to verify correct oscillation behavior.

### Tools Used
- EasyEDA
- Discrete components (Resistors, Capacitors, IC's)
- DC Power Supply
