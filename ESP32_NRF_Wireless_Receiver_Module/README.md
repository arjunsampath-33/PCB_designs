## ESP32-Based NRF Wireless Receiver Module

This project involves the design of a wireless receiver PCB using an ESP32 and an NRF24L01 module.

### Description
The PCB is designed to host an ESP32 development module and an NRF24L01 wireless receiver. Based on the programmed firmware and circuit configuration, the board receives wireless data from a corresponding transmitter module, processes it using the ESP32 and produces output throgh LED.

This receiver board was developed as part of a local academic project focusing on wireless communication and embedded system integration.

### Features
- ESP32 development module interface
- NRF24L01 wireless receiver support
- Onboard status LED with current-limiting resistor
- Compact PCB layout for easy integration

### Tools Used
- EasyEDA (PCB design)
- ESP32 development module
- NRF24L01 wireless transceiver
